# Boston Housing ML Project

This project implements machine learning models to predict housing prices in Boston using different techniques such as decision trees, bagging, and boosting. It provides an easy-to-follow framework for data preprocessing, training, evaluating, and visualizing the results.

## Project Overview

Data is retrieved from https://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston.
The goal of this project is to predict housing prices in Boston based on several features. The dataset is widely used in machine learning for regression tasks. Various regression models are trained, evaluated, and their performances are compared using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² score. Additionally, the project includes cross-validation and visualization of results.
